## Summary

I created a database that can track movie ratings on a daily basis for a movie-subscription based company.

I have included all of the files on this github page but for some reason I could not push from my terminal. I recreated the github page several times and kept getting an error message that another repository was pushing to the same reference. I wasn't sure how to fix so I ended up uploading manually.
